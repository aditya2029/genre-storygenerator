      "members of the group, including Tony, are shown to be performing a mystical ritual. The ritual is actually run by Tony, who is also performing the exorcism. Tony is stepping in to see if the ritual will be over. Tony is then paralyzed by an apparition of a manlike hand emerging from a bottle of milk, and then removes the mask to show a vision of a woman he believes to be his mother, who is actually alive but cold to the touch. Tony is then paralyzed by the neck wound and sent to an asylum.  The doctor believes that the exorcism will be successful, but Tony, still possessed by the hand, reverts to his original self. When Tony reverts to his original self, he is not only not being nice, but also has his mind darkened, and also has his head encased in a crucifix. The professor and Aman and Tony also have a mutual desire to be together, but Tony is secretly jealous of his feelings for the professor. The professor's kindness to Tony is aroused and kept in a reserve play, where Tony rages a scene from a medical supply man who is not under the influence of the hand.  On the ex- clinic, Tony kills the professor by trying to frighten the court and the professor by releasing the hooker's sharpened bandages from his rival's chin. He then proceeds to beat and kill Tony, but is scolded by the professor and the doctor. The professor and Aman also beat the professor to death while also keeping Tony and Tony in the heavy cutting.  During the final sequence, Tony kills the professor by trying to frighten the court, causing the hooker to strike his rival's hook and hand to crush Tony. After a scuffle in which Tony tries to flee with a hook and hand, Tony grabs a crucifix and clubs the professor to death with it. After a scuffle in which Tony is physically watching Tony throughout the film, it is implied that Tony kills the professor by trying to frighten him into a swing, and then sends him to hell. \"\n",
